1. Request a number from the user, save it to a variable, add 2 to the number and display the result on the screen. 
   If an error occurs, read it, remember the lesson and try to fix the error.
2. Using a loop, ask the user for a number until it becomes greater than 0, but less than 10.
After the user enters the correct number, raise it to the power of 2 and display it on the screen.
For example, a user enters the number 123, you tell him that the number is incorrect, and talk about the range of valid ones.
