[7. Homework. Exception Handling]

1. Two lists of fruits are given. Get a list of fruits present in both source lists.
2. A list filled with arbitrary numbers is given. Get a list of the source elements that meet the following conditions
3. Write a function that accepts a list as input. The function creates from this list a new list of square roots of numbers (if the number is positive) and the numbers themselves (if the number is negative) and returns the result (it is desirable to use a generator and a ternary operator if necessary). As a result of the function, the original list should not change.
4. Write a function that accepts a number from 1 to 100 as input. If the number is equal to 13, the function raises an exceptional situation ValueError otherwise returns the entered number squared.
