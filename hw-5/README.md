## Homework. Modules and Libraries
1. Create a module (a module is a Python program, i.e. a file with the .py extension). In it, create a function that creates directories from dir_1 to dir_9 in the folder from which this code is launched. Then create a second function that deletes these folders. Check the operation of the functions in the same module.
2. Create a module. In it, create a function that takes a list and returns a random element from it. If the list is empty, the function should return None. Check the operation of the functions in the same module.
    Note: Enter the list to check manually. Or take this one: [1, 2, 3, 4]
3. Create a module main.py. From the modules implemented in tasks 1 and 2, make an import to main.py of all functions. Call each function in main.py and check that everything works as it should.
Note: Try importing both the entire module (for example, from Task 1) and individual functions from the module.
